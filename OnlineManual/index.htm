		<h1>UC Course Planner User Guide</h1>
		<br />
		The purpose of this guide is to walk you through planning your courses using the UC Course Planning tool.
		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		First, go to the website located at [INSERT URL HERE].  This will display the main page of the course planning tool.  <p />
		<h2>Searching With Filters</h2><p />
		To add your first course you can either enter a filter into the search bar or click and drag on the calendar to select a time block to search in.
		Lets start with the search bar, type a course name, course number, college name, department name, course level or BoK into the search and 
		click the search icon to the right of the search bar.  <p />
		[PUT SCREENSHOT HERE OF TYPING IN SEARCH CRITERIA]
		<p />
		This will add a filter to your current search, which you can see in the filter bubbles below the search bar.  It will also populate the left
		column with courses that fit your current filters.  If no courses fit the filter you typed in, it will say that no courses were returned
		<p />
		[SCREENSHOT OF PAGE WITH ONE FILTER AND COURSE RESULTS]
		<p />
		If you would like to narrow your search you can enter in more filters, or select a time slot on the calendar.
		<p />
		NOTE: If you enter more than one filter of the same type (two course IDs: CS203 and CS506) the results will contain courses that fall under both criteria. 
		So this will show courses with the ID CS203 and CS506 that fall into the other entered criteria as well.  You can also search inside two BoK criteria at the same time, etc.
		<p />
		<h2>Searching With Time Slots</h2>
		<p />
		You can also add a time slot filter to your search which adds time constraints to the courses in your results.  
		To do this simply click and hold on the day and time where you want the time slot to start, then hold down the mouse and 
		drag down to where you want the time slot to end and release the mouse.  You will be able to see the blocks fill in the timeslots you are selecting.
		<p />

		<p />
		After you release the mouse a filter will be added to the filters list showing the time slot you selected.  Now the list of search results will
		only contain courses that occur on the day you selected the timeslot (and potentially more days) and start and end within that time slot. 
		 So, if you selected the time slots from 8 am to 2 pm on Monday, the results would only show courses that start and end between 
		 8 am and 2 pm and occur on that day (could be courses that only occur on Monday, or occur Monday, Wednesday and Friday, etc)
		 <p />
		 You can also select time slots by double clicking on the calendar in the slot you want to fill.  
		 This will select the entire available timeslot on that day. So, if on that day you have a course on the calendar for 8-10 am and another from 1 pm to 2 pm, then 
		 you double click on the 11 am slot, it will select the time slot from 10 am to 1 pm and enter that into the search filters.
		 <p />

		 <h2>Removing Filters From your Search</h2>
		 <p />
		 If your current search has gotten too narrow it may not show any courses, or not enough for you to choose from, or you may want to search in a different BoK.
		 To remove a filter from your current search simply click the X in the top right corner of that filter bubble below the search bar.  This will
		 remove the filter from the current search and show a new list of results.  
		<h2>Adding Courses to your Calendar</h2>
		<p />
		After you have entered search criteria and have a list of course results in the left column, you can start adding courses to your calendar.
		On the right side of each course block there is a plus sign.  Click on the plus sign to expand the course to show more information and all of the sections
		of that course that are offered.
		<p /> 
		[SCREENSHOT OF EXPANDED COURSE TO SHOW SECTIONS]
		<p />
		Once you have found the section you want to add to your calendar you can either double click on it or click and drag it onto the calendar.  
		The calendar will now be highlighted in the times that the course section takes place.  You have added the course to your calendar. 
		The highlighed section will only show the course number of that course but to see more information place your mouse over the highlighted 
		section on the calendar and a box will show displaying the details pertaining to that course schedule.
		<p />

		You can now continue to search and add more courses to your calendar until it looks the way you want and contains the courses you need!
		<p />
		<h2>Removing Courses from the Calendar</h2>
		<p />
		You have probably noticed by now that if you add more than one course to your schedule that occur on the same day and time, 
		it will add both in the same time slot.  While this is helpful for planning, we cannot take more than one course at a time. 
		Once you have decided which course you want to take at that time, you can remove the other by clicking the X in the top right corner of the
		highlighted timeslot.  Make sure to click the X of the course you want to remove, you can tell by the course ID displayed in the highlighted section.
